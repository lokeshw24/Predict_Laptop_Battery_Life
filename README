>Problem Statement : https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/battery

>I have used "single-variable linear regression" as a solution to solve the above problem-statment of machine-learning.

TO_DO :
-------
>The value of alpha matters a lot, it decides the amount of "jump" that we take everytime.
If not properly chosen, the slope doesn't converge to zero, but keeps on toggling.

Ideally, the alpha should be learnt in the program, and should be also changing.
For this need to understand the math behind it.

>The accuracy of the program is not tested, should be done.
